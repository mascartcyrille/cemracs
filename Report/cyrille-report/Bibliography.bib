	abstract = {We study the dynamics of a pair of intrinsically oscillating leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (identical and noise-free) connected by combinations of electrical and inhibitory coupling. We use the theory of weakly coupled oscillators to examine how synchronization patterns are influenced by cellular properties (intrinsic frequency and the strength of spikes) and coupling parameters (speed of synapses and coupling strengths). We find that, when inhibitory synapses are fast and the electrotonic effect of the suprathreshold portion of the spike is large, increasing the strength of weak electrical coupling promotes synchrony. Conversely, when inhibitory synapses are slow and the electrotonic effect of the suprathreshold portion of the spike is small, increasing the strength of weak electrical coupling promotes antisynchrony (see Fig. 10). Furthermore, our results indicate that, given a fixed total coupling strength, either electrical coupling alone or inhibition alone is better at enhancing neural synchrony than a combination of electrical and inhibitory coupling. We also show that these results extend to moderate coupling strengths.},

	abstract = {We investigate how synchrony can be generated or induced in networks of electrically coupled integrate-and-fire neurons subject to noisy and heterogeneous inputs. Using analytical tools, we find that in a network under constant external inputs, synchrony can appear via a Hopf bifurcation from the asynchronous state to an oscillatory state. In a homogeneous net work, in the oscillatory state all neurons fire in synchrony, while in a heterogeneous network synchrony is looser, many neurons skipping cycles of the oscillation. If the transmission of action potentials via the electrical synapses is effectively excitatory, the Hopf bifurcation is supercritical, while effectively inhibitory transmission due to pronounced hyperpolarization leads to a subcritical bifurcation. In the latter case, the network exhibits bistability between an asynchronous state and an oscillatory state where all the neurons fire in synchrony. Finally we show that for time-varying external inputs, electrical coupling enhances the synchronization in an asynchronous network via a resonance at the firing-rate frequency.},

	abstract = {In this paper we analyze the global existence of classical solutions to the initial boundary-value problem for a nonlinear parabolic equation describing the collective behavior of an ensemble of neurons. These equations were obtained as a diffusive approximation of the mean-field limit of a stochastic differential equation system. The resulting Fokker-Planck equation presents a nonlinearity in the coefficients depending on the probability flux through the boundary. We show by an appropriate change of variables that this parabolic equation with nonlinear boundary conditions can be transformed into a non standard Stefan-like free boundary problem with a source term given by a delta function. We prove that there are global classical solutions for inhibitory neural networks, while for excitatory networks we give local well-posedness of classical solutions together with a blow up criterium. Finally, we will also study the spectrum for the linear problem corresponding to uncoupled networks and its relation to Poincar{\textbackslash}'e inequalities for studying their asymptotic behavior.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear Noisy Leaky Integrate and Fire ({NNLIF}) models for neurons networks can be written as Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equations on the probability density of neurons, the main parameters in the model being the connectivity of the network and the noise. We analyse several aspects of the {NNLIF} model: the number of steady states, a priori estimates, blow-up issues and convergence toward equilibrium in the linear case. In particular, for excitatory networks, blow-up always occurs for initial data concentrated close to the firing potential. These results show how critical is the balance between noise and excitatory/inhibitory interactions to the connectivity parameter.},
