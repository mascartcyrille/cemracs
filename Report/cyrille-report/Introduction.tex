One of the first models for neurons was introduced by Louis Lapicque in 1907 and called Integrate and Fire. Neurons are represented in time by the simple electrical equation
	\begin{equation}
		I(t)=C_m\frac{dV_m}{dt}
	\end{equation}
which is just the time derivative of the law of capacitance. A positive current being applied to the membrane, it's potential is going to increase until it reaches a certain threshold value $V_T$, at which point a dirac delta function happens and the voltage of the mambrane is reset to a resting potential.\\
From this model is the basis of a large variety of other neural models invented to model more precisely certain behaviours of neurons and neural networks, as memory, leaking, etc.
